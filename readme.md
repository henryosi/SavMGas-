## User Story

- I am an environmental ninja who wants to reduce my carbon footprint by sharing my ride
- I want to do this without compromising my comfort and time by
    * not have to wait for a driver or passenger
    * not having to waste time searching for drivers or passengers in my route, like weiz
    * I just want to swipe and boom...! my ride comees to me
&&

-  Because regular people like me share the same needs: save for packing, need ride during rush-hour and help the environment
    * I want a ride experience that feels like a community where I can share with my fellow ninjas
    * I want to be able to do more than just rate a driver; I want to share my experience with my community and fellow environmental ninjas
